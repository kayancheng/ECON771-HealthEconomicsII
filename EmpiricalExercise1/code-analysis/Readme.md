## Content description

This folder contains code to perform analysis on processed data from [data-code](https://github.com/kayancheng/ECON771-HealthEconomicsII/tree/main/EmpiricalExercise1/data-code).

All analysis in [our report](https://github.com/kayancheng/ECON771-HealthEconomicsII/blob/main/EmpiricalExercise1/Report.pdf) can be re-produced by ``main-analysis.R``.

On the other hand, ``honestdid_fn.R`` is a function borrowed from Pedro H. C. Sant'Anna's [
CS_RR](https://github.com/pedrohcgs/CS_RR) repo to perform sensitivity analysis tools for potential violations of parallel trends on the Callaway and Sant'Anna DD Estimator.
    
## Instructions

Please make sure you have followed instructions in the [data-code](https://github.com/kayancheng/ECON771-HealthEconomicsII/tree/main/EmpiricalExercise1/data-code) folder to prepare for the processed data before running ``main-analysis.R``.

``honestdid_fn.R`` will be called inside the last section of ``main-analysis.R``.
