## Content description

This folder contains code to perform analysis on processed data from [data-code](https://github.com/kayancheng/ECON771-HealthEconomicsII/tree/main/EmpiricalExercise1/data-code).

All analysis in [our report]() can be re-produced by ``main-analysis.R``.

``honestdid_fn.R`` is a function borrowed from Pedro H. C. Sant'Anna's [
CS_RR](https://github.com/pedrohcgs/CS_RR) repo to perform sensitivity analysis tools for potential violations of parallel trends on the Callaway and Sant'Anna DD Estimator.
